The **KV rating** of a motor represents the number of **revolutions per minute (RPM)** it produces per volt applied.
It is defined as:

$$ KV = \frac{\text{RPM}}{\text{Voltage (V)}} $$

or equivalently,
$$ \text{Motor Speed (RPM)} = KV \times V $$

The KV rating determines the **balance between speed and torque**, influencing propeller size, drone agility, and power efficiency.

### **High KV Motors**

#### **Advantages**

* **Fast Response Time:** React quickly to throttle changes — essential for sharp maneuvers.
* **Lightweight Drones:** Suitable for small drones where rapid acceleration and agility are key.
* **Small Propellers:** Work best with smaller propellers that reduce rotational inertia.

#### **Disadvantages**

* **High Current Draw:** Consume more current, reducing battery life.
* **Lower Torque:** Limited lifting capacity.
* **Increased Heat Generation:** Require efficient cooling systems.

#### **Best For:**

* **Racing drones**, **FPV drones**, and **high-speed performance builds**.

### **Low KV Motors**

#### **Advantages**

* **Higher Torque:** Supports larger propellers for greater lift and stability.
* **Efficient Power Usage:** Lower current draw leads to longer battery life.
* **Stable Flight:** Ideal for carrying cameras or heavy payloads.

#### **Disadvantages**

* **Slower Response Time:** Not ideal for fast directional changes.
* **Less Agile:** Designed for stability over speed.
* **Requires Higher Voltage Batteries:** To achieve adequate thrust at lower RPM.

#### **Best For:**

* **Aerial photography drones**, **heavy-lift drones**, and **long-range endurance drones**.
