# Representation of Discrete Time Signal in terms of Impulses
As we have already understood that [[Signals and Systems Unit Impulse and Unit Step Functions|Unit Impulse]] Signal is one of the key building blocks of the signals one should also know that they can build any signal with the help of just this.
For example
## Example
First $x[n]$ is defined by 

$$\begin{array}{r l}{{x[n]\,=\,.\,.\,+\,x[-3]\delta[n+3]+x[-2]\delta[n+2]+x[-1]\delta[n+1]+x[0]\delta[n]}}\\ {{\qquad\,+\,x[1]\delta[n-1]\,+\,x[2]\delta[n-2]+x[3]\delta[n-3]+.\,.\,.}}\end{array}$$
Thus we can write
$$x[n]\,=\,\sum_{k\,=\,-\infty}^{+\infty}\,x[k]\delta[n-k].$$
Now we look at this other expression derived from this $x[n]$

$$x[-1]\delta[n+1]\,=\,\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{{x[-1],}}&{{n\,=\,-1}}\\ {{0,}}&{{n\neq-1}}\end{array}\right.,$$

### Given expression:
$$
x[-1] \delta[n+1] = 
\begin{cases} 
x[-1], & n = -1 \\ 
0, & n \neq -1
\end{cases}
$$

### Step 1: Understanding the Delta Function
The **discrete-time unit impulse function** (or delta function) is defined as:
$$
\delta[n] =
\begin{cases} 
1, & n = 0 \\ 
0, & n \neq 0
\end{cases}
$$

This means that **$\delta[n+1]$** is a shifted version of $\delta[n]$, given by:
$$
\delta[n+1] =
\begin{cases} 
1, & n = -1 \\ 
0, & n \neq -1
\end{cases}
$$

### Step 2: Multiply by \( $x[-1]$ \)
Multiplying by a constant \( $x[-1]$ \) results in:

$$
x[-1] \delta[n+1] =
\begin{cases} 
x[-1] \cdot 1 = x[-1], & n = -1 \\ 
x[-1] \cdot 0 = 0, & n \neq -1
\end{cases}
$$

### Conclusion:
This is exactly what is given in the problem statement:

$$
x[-1] \delta[n+1] = 
\begin{cases} 
x[-1], & n = -1 \\ 
0, & n \neq -1
\end{cases}
$$

Thus, the result is derived by recognizing that $\delta[n+1]$ is nonzero only when \( n = -1 \), and multiplying it by \( x[-1] \).

#  Convolution

### **Summary Note on Impulse Response $h[n]$ and Convolution of Discrete Signals**

---

#### **What is $h[n]$?**
- **Impulse Response $h[n]$** represents the output of a system when the **input is a unit impulse function** $\delta[n]$, which is a signal that is 1 at $n = 0$ and 0 everywhere else.
- **Definition**: The impulse response tells us how a system responds to a **unit impulse** over time. It is a fixed characteristic of a **linear time-invariant (LTI) system**, meaning it does not change with time.
  
#### **How is $h[n]$ Defined?**
- The impulse response $h[n]$ is defined for all time indices $n$, but in some cases, it may be **non-zero only at specific points**. For example:
  $$
  h[n] = \{ 1, 1, 1 \}, \text{ for } n = 0, 1, 2
  $$
  This means the system responds with 1 at $n = 0$, 1 at $n = 1$, and 1 at $n = 2$. All other values of $h[n]$ are 0.

#### **Resolution of Convolution**
- The **impulse response $h[n]$** can be thought of as defining the **resolution** of the convolution process. This means that the length of $h[n]$ dictates how many past and future points the system "sees" when calculating the output.
  - If $h[n]$ is defined for only 3 points (like $n = 0, 1, 2$), the system has a narrow resolution and only takes into account 3 points of past and future input values when performing the convolution.

#### **Relevance of $h[n]$ to $x[n]$**
- **$x[n]$** is the input signal, and **$h[n]$** defines how the system responds to the input.
- The **convolution** operation combines $x[n]$ with $h[n]$ to produce the output $y[n]$. The system’s **response** to every point of $x[n]$ depends on the values of $h[n]$ at corresponding time shifts.

---

#### **Convolution Formula and Symbolic Representation**

The output $y[n]$ of a system is calculated using the **convolution** of the input signal $x[n]$ and the system’s impulse response $h[n]$. The formula is:

$$
y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k] h[n-k]
$$

- **Convolution Symbolically**: $y[n]$ is the output signal at time $n$, computed by summing the products of the input values $x[k]$ and the corresponding shifted impulse response $h[n-k]$.
- **Shifted Impulse Response**: The term $h[n-k]$ means that the impulse response is shifted by $k$ for each point in the summation, considering past and future values of $x[k]$.

---

#### **Example:**

Let’s use the following simple example to illustrate:

- **Input signal $x[n]$**: $\{1, 2, 3\}$ for $n = 0, 1, 2$
- **Impulse response $h[n]$**: $\{1, 1, 1\}$ for $n = 0, 1, 2$

Now, let’s compute $y[2]$.

$$
y[2] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k] h[2-k]
$$

We only need to consider the values of $x[k]$ and $h[2-k]$ for $k = 0, 1, 2$ because those are the only non-zero values for $x[n]$ and $h[n]$.

- **For $k = 0$**: $x[0] = 1$, $h[2-0] = h[2] = 1$, so this contributes $1 \times 1 = 1$
- **For $k = 1$**: $x[1] = 2$, $h[2-1] = h[1] = 1$, so this contributes $2 \times 1 = 2$
- **For $k = 2$**: $x[2] = 3$, $h[2-2] = h[0] = 1$, so this contributes $3 \times 1 = 3$

Thus:
$$
y[2] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
$$

---

#### **Future Example:**

Now let’s consider a **future example** where the impulse response $h[n]$ still has 3 points, but we will calculate the output for a later value of $y[4]$.

Let’s assume:
- **Input signal $x[n]$**: $\{1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5\}$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$
- **Impulse response $h[n]$**: $\{1, 1, 1\}$ for $n = 0, 1, 2$

We want to calculate $y[4]$.

$$
y[4] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k] h[4-k]
$$

Now, compute the contributions:

- **For $k = 0$**: $x[0] = 1$, $h[4-0] = h[4] = 0$, so this contributes $1 \times 0 = 0$
- **For $k = 1$**: $x[1] = 2$, $h[4-1] = h[3] = 0$, so this contributes $2 \times 0 = 0$
- **For $k = 2$**: $x[2] = 3$, $h[4-2] = h[2] = 1$, so this contributes $3 \times 1 = 3$
- **For $k = 3$**: $x[3] = 0$, $h[4-3] = h[1] = 1$, so this contributes $0 \times 1 = 0$
- **For $k = 4$**: $x[4] = 4$, $h[4-4] = h[0] = 1$, so this contributes $4 \times 1 = 4$

Thus:
$$
y[4] = 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 4 = 7
$$

### **Conclusion:**

- **Impulse Response $h[n]$**: It is the **system’s response** to a unit impulse $\delta[n]$. It is a fixed property of the system, defining how the system reacts over time.
- The **length of $h[n]$** defines the **resolution** of convolution: the number of points in $x[n]$ that contribute to the output $y[n]$ is determined by how long $h[n]$ is.
- The **convolution formula** $y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k] h[n-k]$ combines the input signal $x[n]$ with the shifted impulse response $h[n-k]$ to generate the output signal $y[n]$.

To provide a similar approach to the one found in Oppenheim's "Signals and Systems" book, let's structure the continuous-time signal representation and convolution in a manner that aligns with the book's style. Oppenheim's book is known for its clear and detailed explanations, often accompanied by illustrative examples and step-by-step derivations.

## Representation of Continuous-Time Signals in Terms of Impulses

### Continuous-Time Unit Impulse Function

The continuous-time unit impulse function, denoted as $\delta(t)$, is a fundamental concept in signal processing. It is defined as:

$$
\delta(t) =
\begin{cases}
\infty, & t = 0 \\
0, & t \neq 0
\end{cases}
$$

with the integral property:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t) \, dt = 1
$$

This function is crucial because it allows us to represent any signal as a sum of scaled and shifted impulses.

### Representation of a Continuous-Time Signal

Any continuous-time signal $x(t)$ can be expressed as an integral of impulses:

$$
x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) \delta(t - \tau) \, d\tau
$$

This equation indicates that $x(t)$ can be constructed by integrating over all time shifts $\tau$ of the impulse function $\delta(t)$, each scaled by the value of $x(\tau)$.

## Convolution in Continuous-Time Systems

### Impulse Response $h(t)$

The impulse response $h(t)$ of a continuous-time system is the output of the system when the input is a unit impulse $\delta(t)$. It characterizes the system's response to an impulse over time and is a fundamental property of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.

### Convolution Formula

The output $y(t)$ of a continuous-time system is given by the convolution of the input signal $x(t)$ and the impulse response $h(t)$:

$$
y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t - \tau) \, d\tau
$$

This formula shows that the output $y(t)$ is obtained by integrating the product of the input signal $x(\tau)$ and the shifted impulse response $h(t - \tau)$ over all time shifts $\tau$.

### Example

Let's consider an example to illustrate the convolution in continuous-time systems, similar to the approach in Oppenheim's book.

- **Input signal $x(t)$**: A rectangular pulse defined as:

  $$
  x(t) =
  \begin{cases}
  1, & 0 \leq t \leq 1 \\
  0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

- **Impulse response $h(t)$**: An exponential decay defined as:

  $$
  h(t) =
  \begin{cases}
  e^{-t}, & t \geq 0 \\
  0, & t < 0
  \end{cases}
  $$

To find the output $y(t)$, we compute the convolution:

$$
y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t - \tau) \, d\tau
$$

For $0 \leq t \leq 1$, the convolution integral becomes:

$$
y(t) = \int_{0}^{t} e^{-(t - \tau)} \, d\tau = e^{-t} \int_{0}^{t} e^{\tau} \, d\tau = e^{-t} \left[ e^{\tau} \right]_{0}^{t} = e^{-t} (e^{t} - 1) = 1 - e^{-t}
$$

For $t > 1$, the convolution integral becomes:

$$
y(t) = \int_{0}^{1} e^{-(t - \tau)} \, d\tau = e^{-t} \int_{0}^{1} e^{\tau} \, d\tau = e^{-t} \left[ e^{\tau} \right]_{0}^{1} = e^{-t} (e - 1)
$$

Thus, the output $y(t)$ is:

$$
y(t) =
\begin{cases}
1 - e^{-t}, & 0 \leq t \leq 1 \\
(e - 1)e^{-t}, & t > 1
\end{cases}
$$

---

### Conclusion

- The **continuous-time unit impulse function** $\delta(t)$ is essential for representing continuous-time signals.
- The **impulse response** $h(t)$ characterizes the system's response to an impulse input.
- The **convolution formula** for continuous-time systems combines the input signal $x(t)$ with the shifted impulse response $h(t - \tau)$ to produce the output signal $y(t)$.

This structured approach aligns with the detailed and illustrative style found in Oppenheim's "Signals and Systems" book. If you need further elaboration or additional examples, feel free to ask!
