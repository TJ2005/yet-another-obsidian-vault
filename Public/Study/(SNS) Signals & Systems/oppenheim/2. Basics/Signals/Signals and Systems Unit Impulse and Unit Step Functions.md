# Signals & Systems Unit Impulse and Unit Step Functions
We will look at the unit impulse and step functions in continuous and discrete time.

# Discrete Unit Impulse & Step
## Unit Pulse

^0103f1

One of the simplest discrete-time signals is the unit impulse (or unit sample), which is defined as
$$\delta[n]\,=\,\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{{0,}}&{{n\neq0}}\\ {{1,}}&{{n\,=\,0}}\end{array}\right.$$

## Unit Step
A second basic discrete-time signal is the discrete-time unit step, denoted by $u[n]$ and defined by
$$u[n]\,=\,\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{{0,}}&{{n<0}}\\ {{1,}}&{{n\,\geq\,0}}\end{array}\right.\mathrm{.}$$

## Inter relation between [[Signals and Systems Unit Impulse and Unit Step Functions#Unit Pulse|Unit Pulse]] and [[Signals and Systems Unit Impulse and Unit Step Functions#Unit Step|Unit Step]]
There is a close relationship between the discrete-time unit impulse and unit step. In particular, the discrete-time unit impulse is the first difference of the discrete-time step
$$\delta[n]\,=\,u[n]-u[n-1].$$
Conversely, the discrete-time unit step is the running sum of the unit sample. That is,
$$u[n]\,=\,\sum_{m\,=\,-\infty}^{n}\,\delta[m].$$
To understand first one must realize that the summation value will at most be 1 and not greater than that. This is because the sigma function is defined such. refer [[Signals and Systems Unit Impulse and Unit Step Functions#^cc1469|Unit Impulse]].
Now when the value is 0 it sums up all the values from $-\infty$ to 0 and gets 1 for $u[0]$.
When the value is 1 it sums up all the values from $-\infty$ to 0 and gets 1 for $u[1]$.

Furthermore, by changing the variable of summation from $m$ to $k = n - m$
We get $$u[n]\,=\,\sum_{k\,=\,\infty}^{0}\delta[n-k],$$

# Continuous Unit Impulse & Step
## Unit Impulse
We already can conclude that the unit impulse can be same for both the functions since it only has a value at one point. So for that.

## Unit Step

The continuous-time unit step function $u(t)$ is defined in a manner similar to its discrete time counterpart. Specifically,
$$u(t)\,=\,\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{{0,}}&{{t<0}}\\ {{1,}}&{{t>0}}\end{array}\right.,$$
![[IMG-20260420201540023.png]]
to the relationship between the discrete-time unit impulse and step functions. In particular, the continuous-time unit step is the running integral of the unit impulse
$$u(t)\,=\,\int_{-\infty}^{t}\delta(\tau)\,d\tau.$$
This also suggests a relationship between $\delta(t)$ and $u(t)$ analogous to the expression for $\delta[n]$
the continuous-time unit impulse can be thought of as the first derivative of the continuous-time unit step:
$$\delta(t)\,=\,\frac{d u(t)}{d t}.$$ ^2ce1eb
#### Formally Unsolvable
In contrast to the discrete-time case, there is some formal difficulty with this equation as a representation of the unit impulse function,
since $u(t)$ is discontinuous at $t = 0$ and consequently is formally not differentiable. We can, however, interpret eq. [[Signals and Systems Unit Impulse and Unit Step Functions#^2ce1eb|above]] by considering an approximation to the unit step $u_{\nabla } (t)$, as illustrated in Figure below , which rises from the value 0 to the value 1 in a short time interval of length $\nabla$. The unit step, of course, changes values instantaneously and thus can be thought of as an idealization of   $u_{\nabla } (t)$,  for $\nabla$  so short that its duration doesn't matter for any practical purpose. Formally, $u(t)$ is the limit of $U_{\nabla } (t)$ as Ll ~ 0. Let us now consider the derivative

$$\delta_{\Delta}(t)\,=\,\frac{d u_{\Delta}(t)}{d t},$$
#### Not So Important part 
For a scaled unit impulse
$$\int_{-\infty}^{t}\,k\delta(\tau)\,d\tau\,=\,k u(t).$$
and Multiplication of two functions in a function 
$$x(t)\delta_{\Delta}(t)\approx x(0)\delta_{\Delta}(t).$$
