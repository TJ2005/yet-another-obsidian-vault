# Continuous & Discrete Time Signals
Signals can depict various physical phenomena. All the information in a signal is captured in patterns of some form.
### Example 1 Audio

#### Explanation
In this figure 1.3 The acoustic vibrations are recorded by a device which converts it into electronic signal. This electronic signal. Different sounds make different patterns. Thus we can see the variation.
### Example 2 
![[IMG-20260420201538979.png]]
This is figure depicts the representation of image brightness values. This is a monochromatic image. More on this later.
## **Signals**
Signals are represented mathematically as functions of one or more independent variables.  

A **speech signal** can be represented mathematically by acoustic functions of **time** and **Pressure**. 
Time and Pressure here are both independent variables.

A picture can be represented by a brightness function of two spatial variables.

In our current context we will only look at one single independent variable.
For Convenience we will be focusing on time $t$. 

But they are various signals that are not dependent on time for example this one right here.

# Things to lookout
Throughout the book we will be considering two basic type of signals: continuous time signals and discrete-time signals. A speech signal as a function of time and atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude are examples of continuous-time signals.
## **Continuous Signal**
Throughout this book we will be considering two basic types of signals: continuous time signals and discrete-time signals. In the case of continuous-time signals the independent variable is continuous, and thus these signals are defined for a continuum of values of the independent variable.

A speech signal as a function of time and atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude are examples of continuous-time signals. [[Signals & Systems Intro#^1|Refer Figure 1.5]]
## **Discrete Signal**
On the other hand, discrete-time signals are defined only at discrete times, and consequently, for these signals, the independent variable takes on only a discrete set of values.

The weekly Dow-Jones stock market index, as illustrated in [[Signals & Systems Intro#^2|Figure 1.6]], is an example of a discrete-time signal.

Other examples of discrete-time signals can be found in demographic studies in which various attributes, such as average budget, crime rate, or pounds of fish caught, are tabulated against such discrete variables as family size, total population, or type of fishing vessel, respectively

A Discrete Time Signal $x[n]$ may represent a phenomenon for which the independent variable is inherently discrete. Signals such as demographic data are example of this. 

Most of the Discrete Signals are made from sampling of continuous time signals. In this case, the discrete-time signal $x[n]$ represents successive samples of an underlying phenomenon for which the independent variable is continuous.

**Sampling**: The process of converting a continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal involves taking samples at specific intervals. Each sample represents the signal's value at a particular point.

**Integer Indexing**: The discrete-time signal $x[n]$ is defined only at integer values of $n$. This is analogous to how you can’t reference a fractional sample in a digital signal, similar to how you wouldn’t discuss a family budget in terms of a fraction of a family member.


# How to differentiate between these?
To differentiate between [[#**Continuous Signal**|Continuous Signals]] and Disc

To distinguish between [[#**Continuous Signal**|Continuous-Signal]] and [[#**Discrete Signal**|discrete-time]] signals, we will use the **symbol $t$ to denote the continuous-time independent variable** and **$n$ to denote the discrete time independent variable.** 

In addition, for continuous-time signals we will enclose the independent variable in parentheses $( · )$, whereas for discrete-time signals we will use brackets $[ · ]$ to enclose the independent variable. 

We will also have frequent occasions when it will be useful to represent signals graphically.
Illustrations of a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ and a discrete-time signal $x[n]$ are shown in Figure 1.7. It is important to note that the discrete-time signal $x[n]$ is defined only for integer values of the independent variable. Our choice of graphical representation for $x[ n]$ emphasizes this fact, and for further emphasis we will on occasion refer to $x[n]$ as a discrete-time sequence.

# Signal Energy And Power
From the range of examples provided so far, we see that signals may represent a broad variety of phenomena. In many, but not all, applications, the signals we consider are directly related to physical quantities capturing power and energy in a physical system. 

### Example to understand Power and energy
The best way to understand power would be to corelate it with the already learned power in our basic electrical engineering.
For example,

if $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ are, respectively, the voltage and current across a resistor with resistance $R$, then the instantaneous power is
$$p(t)\,=\,\nu(t)i(t)\,=\,\frac{1}{R}\nu^{2}(t).$$
We have studied this in the 11th Grade that $P = V \times I$. Substitute $v(t)$ for $\frac{v}{r}$ and we get the above

If the resistance were to be unit resistance we can ignore it $1$ as $p(t)=v^2$ and we get the basic formula of power   

$$$\begin{array}{c}{{\mathrm{The~total~}e n e r g y~\mathrm{expended~over~the~time~interval}~t_{1}\,\leq\,t\,\leq\,t_{2}~\mathrm{is}}}\\ {{\displaystyle\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}p(t)\,d t=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\frac{1}{R}v^{2}(t)\,d t,}}\\ {{\mathrm{and~the~}a v e r a g e\,p o w e r~\mathrm{over~this~time~interval}~\mathrm{is}}}\\ {{\displaystyle\frac{1}{t_{2}-t_{1}}\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}p(t)\,d t=\frac{1}{t_{2}-t_{1}}\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\frac{1}{R}v^{2}(t)\,d t.}}\end{array}$$
