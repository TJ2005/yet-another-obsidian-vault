### Introduction to Cybersecurity Fundamentals

- [[#Threat Modeling]]

#### Overview
- **Purpose:** Understanding the foundational knowledge acquired during the first two years of a BTech program, which is essential for grasping how computers and networks operate.
- **Importance:** Abstracting the teaching process is not feasible; hence, a solid understanding of these fundamentals is expected.
#### Legal Requirements

- **Key Regulations:**
    - Information Technology Act (ITA)
    - Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDA)
    - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

#### Human Aspects

- **Trust and Awareness:** Essential components in cybersecurity, focusing on the end-user's role.
- **Cybersecurity Risk Management:** Involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with information security.

#### Threat Modeling
- **Definition:** A structured approach to identifying security requirements, threats, vulnerabilities, and prioritizing remediation methods.
- **Objective:** Understand and communicate threats and mitigations to protect valuable assets.
##### Components of Threat Modeling
- **Scope:** Description of the subject being modeled.
- **Assumptions:** Conditions that can be verified or challenged as the threat landscape evolves.
- **Threats:** Potential threats to the system.
- **Mitigations:** Actions to mitigate identified threats.
- **Validation:** Methods to validate the model and the effectiveness of actions taken.
##### Applications
- Applicable to software, applications, systems, networks, distributed systems, IoT devices, and business processes.
##### Attack Trees
- **Definition:** Diagrams representing attacks on a system in a tree structure.
- **Structure:**
    - **Root:** The goal of the attack.
    - **Leaves:** Methods to achieve the goal.
- **Usage:** Each goal is represented as a separate tree, resulting in a set of attack trees for system threat analysis.
#### Example of Threat Modeling
- **Scenario:** Protecting a diamond ring from theft.
    - **Vulnerabilities:** Identify when and how the ring might be removed or stolen.
    - **Attack Tree:** Build a tree of potential attacks and choose the most efficient and probable path.
#### Defense Mechanisms
- **Budgeting:** Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of security measures.
    - **Example:** Implementing RFID anti-theft measures for lab mice.
        - **Cost Analysis:** Weigh the cost of security implementation against potential losses.

# Our Love with Internet

*(Doom Scrollers, Multiple Apps, Rabbit Share, etc.)*

## Scenario 1 – Insider Bank Data Theft

* You are a **bank employee**.
* **Russian hackers** bribe you to steal bank data.
* You **FTP the data** to a U.S. server data bucket.
* **No logs recorded**.
* Money laundering chain: Russians → Dude in Germany → Dude in UK → You receive money in a 5th country.
* **Catching the culprit is very hard** because:

  * Multi-country involvement.
  * Cross-jurisdictional transfers.
  * Insider access hides footprints.
* **Prevention is more effective**:

  * Make the sensitive data difficult to extract or use.
  * Deploy monitoring & strict access controls.

## Nation-State Cyber Threats

* **Main threats**: State and Nation-sponsored attacks.
* **Example – Iran Nuclear Program**:

  * Iran wanted to build nuclear weapons.
  * Their nuclear facilities had an **air-gapped system** (isolated from the internet).
  * Still compromised via an **insider using USB-based malware payload** (e.g., *Stuxnet*).
  * Shows how **air-gaps are not foolproof** if insiders are compromised.

## Real-World Cybersecurity Cases

### Ashley Madison (Dating Website)

* Tagline: *“Life is short. Have an affair.”*
* They offered a **\$20 plan to delete user data**.
* Data was **not actually deleted**.
* Users registered with **personal emails**.
* Massive breach exposed identities.
* **Consequences**:

  * Blackmail, reputational damage.
  * Some users committed **suicide** due to exposure.
* Lesson: **Leaving a service ≠ security**.

### Health Data Breaches

* **If health data leaks** (e.g., terminal illness):
  * Insurance premiums may spike.
  * Individuals face discrimination.
  * Exploited for fraud and blackmail.

---

### Capital One (Banking)

* Breach exploited an **Apache server vulnerability**.
* Compromised **100 million card details**.
* Lessons:

  * Keep infrastructure patched.
  * Vulnerabilities in open-source software can have massive consequences.

## Key Lessons

* **Insider threats** are as dangerous as external hackers.
* **Air-gaps are not foolproof** – physical access can still bypass them.
* **Data deletion promises must be verifiable** (Ashley Madison).
* **Health data is highly sensitive** – leaks can change people’s lives.
* **Patching & monitoring open-source systems is critical** (Capital One).
* **Mass breaches show repeated patterns**:

  * Weak APIs, misconfigurations, unpatched vulnerabilities.
  * Data often ends up in black markets.
