# Cybersecurity Fundamentals Lab 2

## Aim 
To study MITRE att&ck framework and cyber skill chain 

## A little introduction
* **MITRE ATT\&CK®** = MITRE *Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge*.
* It’s a **curated knowledge base** of real-world cyber adversary behavior.
* Models the **attack lifecycle** and targeted platforms.
* Uses a **common taxonomy** for offensive and defensive understanding.
* Core components:
  * **Tactics** – short-term adversary goals (columns).
  * **Techniques** – methods used to achieve those goals (cells).
  * **Metadata** – documented real-world usage and defenses.

## A table of Attacks
Consider : Operation Silent Vault is a fictional cyber-attack scenario in which a financially motivated threat actor group targets a mid-sized bank’s online customer portal. Their objective is to steal customer login credentials through phishing and malware and then perform unauthorized financial transactions. 

Identify the various tactics and techniques that threat actor group may use. Prepare a table as shown below

## Questions and answers

**1. Compare and contrast ATT\&CK framework and Cyber Kill Chain**

* **Scope:**

  * *Cyber Kill Chain* – Linear, high-level attack progression model (7 stages).
  * *MITRE ATT\&CK* – Detailed, non-linear knowledge base of adversary tactics/techniques.
* **Focus:**

  * *Kill Chain* – Overall phases from intrusion to impact.
  * *ATT\&CK* – Specific techniques, procedures, and mappings to real-world threats.
* **Usage:**

  * *Kill Chain* – Strategic view for detection points in the attack lifecycle.
  * *ATT\&CK* – Tactical/technical mapping for detection, hunting, and testing.
* **Detail Level:**

  * *Kill Chain* – Broad stage descriptions.
  * *ATT\&CK* – Granular behaviors, IDs, mitigation, detection guidance.

---

**2. How Cyber Kill Chain complements MITRE ATT\&CK in threat detection & response**

* Kill Chain = **macro-level** map of attacker journey.
* ATT\&CK = **micro-level** library of how each stage is executed.
* Together:

  * Kill Chain shows **where** in the lifecycle the attack is.
  * ATT\&CK shows **how** the attacker is operating at that stage.
  * Improves detection coverage, prioritization, and incident response playbooks.

---

**3. “Command and Control over DNS” (T1071.004)**

* **Kill Chain Stage:** Command and Control (C2).
* **Effective Countermeasures:**

  * Monitor for unusual DNS query volumes and patterns.
  * Use DNS filtering/blocking for suspicious domains.
  * Implement network anomaly detection.
  * Restrict and log external DNS requests.

---

**4. Why early detection (Reconnaissance & Delivery) is more cost-effective**

* Earlier disruption = **less attacker foothold**, less cleanup needed.
* Prevents **data theft, system compromise, and financial loss** before damage occurs.
* Cost to remediate increases **exponentially** with each stage progressed.
* Early stages often leave **more visible, low-cost detection opportunities** (email filters, intel monitoring).

---

**5. Variants of the MITRE ATT\&CK framework**

* **Enterprise ATT\&CK** – TTPs for Windows, macOS, Linux, cloud, and enterprise systems.
* **Mobile ATT\&CK** – TTPs for Android and iOS attacks.
* **ICS ATT\&CK** – TTPs for Industrial Control Systems and OT environments.
* **PRE-ATT\&CK** *(now merged into Enterprise)* – TTPs for pre-compromise activities (planning, reconnaissance).
